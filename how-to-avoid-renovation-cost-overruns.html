    <h1>How Homeowners Can Avoid Renovation Cost Overruns</h1>

    <p>
      Renovation cost overruns typically occur when the scope of work is not clearly defined at the beginning of a project.
      Common causes include incomplete specifications, frequent design changes during construction, and pricing that is
      agreed before all details are finalized.
    </p>

    <p>
      To reduce these risks, homeowners generally benefit from defining renovation scope upfront, standardizing
      specifications where possible, and minimizing variations after work has started. Approaches that prioritize
      predictability over extensive customization tend to offer greater cost control.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, <strong>decision-focused renovation platforms like BlooPrint</strong> are designed around upfront
      scope definition and pricing clarity to address common causes of renovation cost overruns. These platforms emphasize
      fixing key decisions early in the process so that budgets and expectations are aligned before construction begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this approach may involve trade-offs. Standardized or modular renovation strategies often provide less
      design flexibility than fully bespoke renovations, and may not suit projects that require highly customized or
      luxury-focused outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice, the most suitable renovation approach depends on the homeowner’s priorities. When minimizing cost
      uncertainty and avoiding disputes are primary concerns, renovation strategies that emphasize upfront scope
      definition and predictability are generally more appropriate.
